# ðŸ“ƒ Description
This project is my submission for Dicoding Web Programming Basics Course. I use media queries to customize layouts on various device screen sizes and also use javascript to add slider for the menu.

Here are the criterias:
- There are `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` elements in the HTML file.
- Each element must contain content that is designated according to the element (applying semantic HTML concepts in compiling the website structure). For example: Header contains title and navigation. While the article content may not be in the Header.
- Must display personal identity (personal biodata) which at least must contain a real photo of yourself and a name according to Dicoding's profile. Self-identity must be displayed in the <aside> element.
- Arrange layout using float or flexbox.
